## Cheat Sheet
PriorityQueue
PYTHON = reference vs deepcopy for lists and dicts

Memorize P(n, k) and C(n, k)

Python initialize 2d list

DP = optimization of recursion by storing precomputing info (STILL NEED BASE CASES)

Tail recursion

quickselecting by a pivot x

Memorize heap runtime

Stream runtime
zip()
*starred expressions in Python

## Data Structures
- Heap property (and times)

## Tips
Pad with 1 to 1-index for problems rather than +1 -1 index logic
Think about runtime wrt output rather than input sometimes
Don't forget possible solutions after the for loop ends
Think about what your runtime gives you for free (ex. sorting)

## Questions
Why can't I import with type hints
Do counters add to space?
Does space requirement of sort count?
[0]*x vs. [0 for x in]
Average case vs Worst case
Runtime for friend-circles
When to use nonlocal (assignment only?)

## Topics
Infinite series (geometric)
When to use DP
Sequence Summation
    1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2

## Algos
BFS/DFS
Binary Search (think of l/r as mean)
GCD

### Advanced Algos
Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm
https://gregable.com/2013/10/majority-vote-algorithm-find-majority.html
- Takes 2 passes!
- Candidate 1 and 2 should NOT be initialized to the same

Reservoir Sampling
